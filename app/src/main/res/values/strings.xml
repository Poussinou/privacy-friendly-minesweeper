    <string name="help_whatis">What is Privacy Friendly Minesweeper?</string>
    <string name="help_whatis_answer">Privacy Friendly Minesweeper is a minesweeper game that belongs to the group of privacy friendly apps.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_one">Are there different game modes available?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_one_answer">Yes, you can choose between the game modes \'easy\', \'medium\', \'difficult\' and \'user-defined\'.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_two">How can I find mines?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_two_answer">Every field has exactly as much mines under the 9 fields in its surrounding as the number on the field indicates. The number becomes visible when the field is uncovered by clicking on it. Logically combining the numbers on several uncovered fields enables you to identify fields that contain a mine.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_three">What is the use of setting a flag on a field?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_three_answer">Marked fields can not be uncovered by accident. Moreover, if you click on an already uncovered field and the number of flags on the 9 surrounding fields equals its number, all 9 surrounding fields are uncovered.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_four">What does the toolbar show while playing?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_four_answer">While playing, the toolbar displays the level of difficulty, the difference between marked fields and the number of mines and the time played so far.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_five">Can I mark fields when I think there is a mine?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_five_answer">You can mark fields with a flag if you think that they contain a mine. You need to activate the marking mode to do so. You can remove flags by clicking on a marked field again.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_six">Can I track the my performance?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_six_answer">You can track your performance and top times on the statistics page.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_seven">What is the difference between the levels of difficulty?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_seven_answer">The higher the level of difficulty, the higher is the portion of mines on the playing field. Additionally, the number of fields on the playing field increases with the degree of difficulty. \nEasy: 6x10 fields, 7 mines \nMedium: 10x16 fields, 24 mines \nDifficult: 12x19 fields, 46 mines</string>
    <string name="help_feature_eight">What is the user defined game mode?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_eight_answer">In the user defined game mode, you can freely choose the size of the playing field and the degree of difficulty.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_nine">How does the game work?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_nine_answer">Under the fields of the playing field are numbers and mines. The aim of the game is to uncover all fields of the playing field without triggering a mine.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_ten">Can I continue games I started earlier?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_ten_answer">Yes. Games that are left using the Back-Button are saved and can be continued from the saved games menu, accessible over the Button \'Continue Game\' in the main menu. The last ten games are stored.</string>
    <string name="help_feature_eleven">What happens if I uncover a field that contains a mine?</string>
    <string name="help_feature_eleven_answer">If you uncover a field that contains a mine, you lost.</string>
